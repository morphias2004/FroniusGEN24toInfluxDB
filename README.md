# FroniusGEN24toInfluxDB
This Python script will pull data from a Fronius Primo GEN24 Inverter and an attached Smart Meter via the Fronius API's and then publish the data to an InfluxDB for use with Grafana.

You can then connect to the InfluxDB with Grafana and produce all sorts of pretty graphs and guages! :)
